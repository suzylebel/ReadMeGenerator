## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```


## Getting Started

Using Node.js and the npm package Inquirer I was able to code a readme generator based on users response in the command line of the terminal. 

There is a video screen capture that highlights the terminal side of this project. Screen shots are also included in this readme file. In my video walk though I do 2 examples of going through the terminal command line questions and include screenshots for both!
